"""
guardrails/output_guard.py — Per-citation output grounding check.

After the single agent generates an answer, this module verifies that each
individual "[label]" citation in the answer is actually supported by the
specific source text behind that label — not just that the answer as a
whole is "plausible" given the union of everything retrieved.

Previous version (whole-answer check)
--------------------------------------
The original implementation compared the full answer against the top 6
retrieved chunks concatenated together, in one LLM call, for one binary
GROUNDED / NOT_GROUNDED verdict. That is structurally blind to citation
*attribution* errors: if the true fact ("a public deed is required") is
present *somewhere* in the combined context, the whole-answer check
passes even when the answer attached that fact to the wrong label (e.g.
"[Art. 159]" instead of "[Art. 162]"). The content is grounded; the
citation is not — and the old check had no way to tell the difference.

This version
------------
1. Parse the answer into sentences and find every "[label]" citation.
2. For each (sentence, label) pair:
   - if `label` isn't in the supplied label -> source-text map at all,
     flag it immediately as an unknown/invented citation (no LLM call
     needed — this is a pure lookup failure);
   - otherwise, ask a small/fast model whether that *specific* source
     text supports that *specific* sentence (not the whole answer).
3. Only the citations that fail (or whose source is missing) get a
   warning; citations that pass are left alone. This is a much more
   precise signal than a single pass/fail verdict over everything.

This is still a secondary safety net, not the primary answer path: any
failure (LLM API timeout, rate limit, unparseable response, regex edge case)
must never crash the pipeline. Failures degrade to a neutral notice
rather than raising, exactly like before.

        Map from citation label (e.g. "Art. 162", or a CASE_ID) to the raw
        source text retrieved for it. Built from the single-agent retrieved_documents.

        Map from citation label to source country, retained for compatibility.
        The single-agent adapter excludes ambiguous source/country labels;
        indirect-reference matching is disabled in this version.
